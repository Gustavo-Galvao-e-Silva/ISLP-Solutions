# An Introduction to Statistical Learning — Solutions & Explorations

This repository contains my worked solutions, explanations, and exploratory analyses for selected exercises from  
**An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python (ISLP)**.

The goal of this project is to answer the textbook questions, and present clean, well-documented, reproducible analyses in Jupyter notebooks, suitable for review as a learning portfolio.

## 📘 Contents

- **Chapter 2**
  - Question 9 — Auto dataset: predictor analysis, summary statistics, and correlations
  - Question 10 — Boston housing dataset: structure and predictor analysis, summary statistics, and correlations

(Additional chapters and exercises will be added progressively.)

## 🧠 Approach

Each notebook follows a consistent structure:

1. **Problem context and objective**
2. **Concise written solution** (answers presented first)
3. **Code used to compute results**
4. **Formatted tables and visualizations** rendered via Jupyter

## ⚠️ Notes

This repository is intended for educational and portfolio purposes only.

All interpretations are my own and aim to demonstrate understanding rather than exhaustively analyze each dataset.

## 📌 Future Work
Additional chapters and exercises

More visualizations and deeper exploratory analysis

Regression modeling in later chapters
